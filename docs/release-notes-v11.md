audit logging via the standard logging facility provided by PostgreSQL

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is also shipped with the [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq.html) library. It contains “a set of
library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL
backend server and to receive the results of these queries.” [^1]

This release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is based on PostgreSQL 11.
