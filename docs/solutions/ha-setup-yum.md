# Deploying PostgreSQL for high availability with Patroni on RHEL or CentOS

This guide provides instructions on how to set up a highly available PostgreSQL cluster with Patroni on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. 


## Preconditions

For this setup, we will use the nodes running on CentOS 8 as the base operating system and having the following IP addresses:

| Hostname      | Public IP address | Internal IP address
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------
| node1         | 157.230.42.174    | 10.104.0.7
| node2         | 68.183.177.183    | 10.104.0.2
| node3         | 165.22.62.167     | 10.104.0.8
| etcd          | 159.102.29.166    | 10.104.0.5
| HAProxy-demo  | 134.209.111.138   | 10.104.0.6

!!! note

    In a production (or even non-production) setup, the PostgreSQL and ETCD nodes will be within a private subnet without any public connectivity to the Internet, and the HAProxy will be in a different subnet that allows client traffic coming only from a selected IP range. To keep things simple, we have implemented this architecture in a DigitalOcean VPS environment, and each node can access the other by its internal, private IP. 

## Setting up hostnames in the `/etc/hosts` file

To make the nodes aware of each other and allow their seamless communication, resolve their hostnames to their public IP addresses. Modify the `/etc/hosts` file of each PostgreSQL node to include the hostnames and IP addresses of the remaining nodes. The following is the `/etc/hosts` file for `node1`:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost node1
10.104.0.7 node1 
10.104.0.2 node2 
10.104.0.8 node3
```

The `/etc/hosts` file of the `HAProxy-demo` node hostnames and IP addresses of all PostgreSQL nodes:

```
127.0.1.1 HAProxy-demo HAProxy-demo
127.0.0.1 localhost
10.104.0.6 HAProxy-demo
10.104.0.7 node1
10.104.0.2 node2
10.104.0.8 node3
```

Keep the `/etc/hosts` file of the `etcd` node unchanged.

## Configure ETCD distributed store  

The distributed configuration store helps establish a consensus among nodes during a failover and will manage the configuration for the three PostgreSQL instances. Although Patroni can work with other distributed consensus stores (i.e., Zookeeper, Consul, etc.), the most commonly used one is `etcd`. 

In this setup we will configure ETCD on a dedicated  node.

1. Install `etcd` on the ETCD node. For CentOS 8, the etcd packages are available from Percona repository:

   - [Install `percona-release`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/installing.html).
   - Enable the repository:

      ```sh
      sudo percona-release setup ppg11
      ```
   
   - Install the etcd packages using the following command:

      ```sh
      $ sudo yum install etcd python3-python-etcd
      ```

2. Modify the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` configuration file:

   ```text
   [Member]
   ETCD_DATA_DIR="/var/lib/etcd/default.etcd"
   ETCD_LISTEN_PEER_URLS="http://10.104.0.5:2380,http://localhost:2380" 
   ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS="http://10.104.0.5:2379,http://localhost:2379"


   ETCD_NAME="default"
   ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS="http://10.104.0.5:2380"
   ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS="http://10.104.0.5:2379"
   ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="default=http://10.104.0.5:2380"
   ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_TOKEN="etcd-cluster"
   ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="new"
   ```

3.  Start the `etcd` to apply the changes:

    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl enable etcd
    $ sudo systemctl start etcd
    $ sudo systemctl status etcd
    ```

5. Check the etcd cluster members.
    
    ```sh
    $ sudo etcdctl member list
    ```

    The output resembles the following:

    ```
    21d50d7f768f153a: name=default peerURLs=http://10.104.0.5:2380 clientURLs=http://10.104.0.5:2379 isLeader=true
    ```

## Install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL

Install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on `node1`, `node2` and `node3` from Percona repository:

1. [Install `percona-release`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/installing.html).
2. Enable the repository:

    ```sh
    sudo percona-release setup ppg11
    ```

3. [Install Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL packages](../installing.md#on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-and-centos-using-yum).

!!! important

    **Don't** initialize the cluster and start the `postgresql` service. The cluster initialization and setup are handled by Patroni during the bootsrapping stage.

## Configure Patroni

1. Install Patroni on every PostgreSQL node:

    ```sh
    $ sudo yum install percona-patroni
    ```

2. Install the Python module that enables Patroni to communicate with ETCD.

    ```sh
    sudo python3 -m pip install patroni[etcd]
    ```

3. Create the directories required by Patroni

    * Create the directory to store the configuration file and make it owned by the `postgres` user.

      ```sh
      sudo mkdir -p /etc/patroni/
      sudo chown -R  postgres:postgres /etc/patroni/
      ``` 

    * Create the data directory for Patroni. Change its ownership to the `postgres` user and restrict the access to it 

     ```sh
     sudo mkdir /data/patroni -p
     sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /data/patroni
     sudo chmod 700 /data/patroni
     ```

4. Create the `patroni.yml` configuration file. 

    ```sh
    su postgres
    vim /etc/patroni/patroni.yml
    ```

5. Specify the following configuration:
 
    ```yaml
    scope: postgres
    namespace: /pg_cluster/
    name: node1

    restapi:
      listen: 10.104.0.7:8008            # PostgreSQL node IP address
      connect_address: 10.104.0.7:8008   # PostgreSQL node IP address

    etcd:
      host: 10.104.0.5:2379  # ETCD node IP address

    bootstrap:
      # this section will be written into Etcd:/<namespace>/<scope>/config after initializing new cluster
      dcs:
        ttl: 30
        loop_wait: 10
        retry_timeout: 10
        maximum_lag_on_failover: 1048576
        postgresql:
          use_pg_rewind: true
          use_slots: true
          parameters:

            hot_standby: "on"
            logging_collector: 'on'
            max_wal_senders: 5
            max_replication_slots: 5
            wal_log_hints: "on"
            
      # some desired options for 'initdb'
      initdb:  # Note: It needs to be a list (some options need values, others are switches)
      - encoding: UTF8
      - data-checksums

      pg_hba:  # Add following lines to pg_hba.conf after running 'initdb'
      - host replication replicator 127.0.0.1/32 md5
      - host replication replicator 10.104.0.2/32 md5  
      - host replication replicator 10.104.0.8/32 md5 
      - host replication replicator 10.104.0.7/32 md5
      - host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5
    #  - hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

      # Some additional users users which needs to be created after initializing new cluster
      users:
        admin:
          password: admin
          options:
            - createrole
            - createdb
        
    postgresql:
      listen: 10.104.0.7:5432            # PostgreSQL node IP address
      connect_address: 10.104.0.7:5432   # PostgreSQL node IP address
      data_dir: /data/patroni            # The datadir you created
      bin_dir: /usr/pgsql-11/bin
      pgpass: /tmp/pgpass0
      authentication:
        replication:
          username: replicator
          password: replicator
        superuser:
          username: postgres
          password: postgres
      parameters:
        unix_socket_directories: '.'

    tags:
        nofailover: false
        noloadbalance: false
        clonefrom: false
        nosync: false
    ```

6. Create the configuration files for `node2` and `node3`. Replace the node  and IP address of `node1` to those of `node2` and `node3`, respectively.

7. Create the systemd unit file `patroni.service` in `/etc/systemd/system`. 

    ```sh
    sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/patroni.service
    ```

    Add the following contents in the file:
   
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Runners to orchestrate a high-availability PostgreSQL
    After=syslog.target network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    User=postgres
    Group=postgres

    # Start the patroni process
    ExecStart=/bin/patroni /etc/patroni/patroni.yml

    # Send HUP to reload from patroni.yml
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID

    # only kill the patroni process, not its children, so it will gracefully stop postgres
    KillMode=process

    # Give a reasonable amount of time for the server to start up/shut down
    TimeoutSec=30

    # Do not restart the service if it crashes, we want to manually inspect database on failure
    Restart=no

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

8. Make systemd aware of the new service:

    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl enable patroni
    $ sudo systemctl start patroni
    ```

    ??? admonition "Troubleshooting Patroni"

            To ensure that Patroni has started properly, check the logs using the following command:

            ```sh
            $ sudo journalctl -u patroni.service -n 100 -f
            ```

            The output shouldn't show any errors:

            ```
            â€¦

            A common error is Patroni complaining about the lack of proper entries in the pg_hba.conf file. If you see such errors, you must manually add or fix the entries in that file and then restart the service.

            Changing the patroni.yml file and restarting the service will not have any effect here because the bootstrap section specifies the configuration to apply when PostgreSQL is first started in the node. It will not repeat the process even if the Patroni configuration file is modified and the service is restarted. 

            If Patroni has started properly, you should be able to locally connect to a PostgreSQL node using the following command:

            ```sh
            $ sudo psql -U postgres

            psql (11.13)
            Type "help" for help.

            postgres=#
            ```

9. Configure, enable and start Patroni on the remaining nodes.
10. When all nodes are up and running, you can check the cluster status using the following command:

   ```sh
   $ sudo patronictl -c /etc/patroni/patroni.yml list
   

   + Cluster: postgres (7011110722654005156) -----------+
   | Member | Host  | Role    | State   | TL | Lag in MB |
   +--------+-------+---------+---------+----+-----------+
   | node1  | node1 | Leader  | running |  1 |           |
   | node2  | node2 | Replica | running |  1 |         0 |
   | node3  | node3 | Replica | running |  1 |         0 |
   +--------+-------+---------+---------+----+-----------+
   ```

## Configure HAProxy

HAProxy node will accept client connection requests and route those to the active node of the PostgreSQL cluster. This way, a client application doesnâ€™t have to know what node in the underlying cluster is the current primary. All it needs to do is to access a single HAProxy URL and send its read/write requests there. Behind-the-scene, HAProxy routes the connection to a healthy node (as long as there is at least one healthy node available) and ensures that client application requests are never rejected. 

HAProxy is capable of routing write requests to the primary node and read requests - to the secondaries in a round-robin fashion so that no secondary instance is unnecessarily loaded. To make this happen, provide different ports in the HAProxy configuration file. In this deployment, writes are routed to port 5000 and reads  - to port 5001.

1. Install HAProxy on the `HAProxy-demo` node:

    ``` sh
    $ sudo yum install haproxy
    ```

2. The HAProxy configuration file path is: `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`. Specify the following configuration in this file.

    ```
    global
        maxconn 100

    defaults
        log global
        mode tcp
        retries 2
        timeout client 30m
        timeout connect 4s
        timeout server 30m
        timeout check 5s

    listen stats
        mode http
        bind *:7000
        stats enable
        stats uri /

    listen primary
        bind *:5000
        option httpchk /primary 
        http-check expect status 200
        default-server inter 3s fall 3 rise 2 on-marked-down shutdown-sessions
        server node1 node1:5432 maxconn 100 check port 8008
        server node2 node2:5432 maxconn 100 check port 8008
        server node3 node3:5432 maxconn 100 check port 8008

    listen standbys
        balance roundrobin
        bind *:5001
        option httpchk /replica 
        http-check expect status 200
        default-server inter 3s fall 3 rise 2 on-marked-down shutdown-sessions
        server node1 node1:5432 maxconn 100 check port 8008
        server node2 node2:5432 maxconn 100 check port 8008
        server node3 node3:5432 maxconn 100 check port 8008
    ```


    HAProxy will use the REST APIs hosted by Patroni to check the health status of each PostgreSQL node and route the requests appropriately. 

3. Enable a SELinux boolean to allow HAProxy to bind to non standard ports:

    ```sh
    sudo setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any on
    ```

4. Restart HAProxy:
    
    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl restart haproxy
    ```

5. Check the HAProxy logs to see if there are any errors:
   
    ```sh
    $ sudo journalctl -u haproxy.service -n 100 -f
    ```
