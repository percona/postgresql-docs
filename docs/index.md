# Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 14 Documentation

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is a collection of tools to assist you in managing your PostgreSQL
database system: it installs PostgreSQL and complements it by a selection of
extensions that enable solving essential practical tasks efficiently:


* [pg_repack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack) rebuilds
PostgreSQL database objects


* [pgAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) provides detailed session or object
audit logging via the standard PostgreSQL logging facility

* [pgAudit set_user](https://github.com/pgaudit/set_user) - The `set_user` part of `pgAudit` extension provides an additional layer of logging and control when unprivileged users must escalate themselves to superuser or object owner roles in order to perform needed maintenance tasks.

* [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) is a backup and restore solution for
PostgreSQL


* [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an HA (High Availability) solution for PostgreSQL.


* [pg_stat_monitor](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor) (Tech Preview Feature [^1]) collects and aggregates statistics for PostgreSQL and provides histogram information.

* [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) - a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL
 

* [pgBadger](https://github.com/darold/pgbadger) - a fast PostgreSQL Log Analyzer.


* [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) - a PostgreSQL logical decoding JSON output plugin.
