# Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 14 Documentation

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is a collection of tools to assist you in managing your PostgreSQL
database system: it installs PostgreSQL and complements it by a selection of
extensions that enable solving essential practical tasks efficiently:


* [pg_repack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack) rebuilds
PostgreSQL database objects


* [pgAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) provides detailed session or object
audit logging via the standard PostgreSQL logging facility

* [pgAudit set_user](https://github.com/pgaudit/set_user) - The `set_user` part of `pgAudit` extension provides an additional layer of logging and control when unprivileged users must escalate themselves to superuser or object owner roles in order to perform needed maintenance tasks.

PostgreSQL


* [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an HA (High Availability) solution for PostgreSQL.

* [`pgpool`](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgpool2.git;a=summary) - a middleware between PostgreSQL server and client for high availability, connection pooling and load balancing.

these queries." [^1]
